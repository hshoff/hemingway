Hemingway
=========

A Chrome browser extension for hacking hackpad with custom hackpadery.

## Easy Install

1. Clone the repo to some `~/PATH/`
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` ([extensions](chrome://extensions/))
3. Check `Developer Mode` checkbox in the upper right if not already
4. Click `Load unpacked extensions...`
5. Select `~/PATH/hemingway`
6. Write the next great American novel

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Hemingway uses  `cmd` as the modifier and tries to match Sublime Text's keyboard shortcuts, cause I'm lazy and don't want to retrain my fingers. Note that this overrides some regular Chrome browser shortcuts (cmd+[ and cmd+] navigate forward or backwards in your history).

- Indent: `cmd+]`  (Hackpad default is tab)
- Outdent: `cmd+[` (Hackpad default is shift+tab)
- Comment: `cmd+/` (this overrides Hackpad's cmd+/ which focuses search)
- Toggle Focus Mode: `cmd+shift+f`

## Comments Style

My prefered visual for nested comments.

## Inline code

Using backticks to wrap `code` styles code like github flavored markdown does.

## Focus Mode

A calming snow falls on your document and everything goes quiet.
